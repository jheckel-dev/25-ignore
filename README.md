# birthday-project:
     In this app we are taking the users DOB and putting it into two separate APIs to show the users astrological information and important events on that day in history.

 ## Motivation:
     Birthday's are special days, and people want to know what was going on when it was their day. When a user inserts the date of their latest brithday we provide them with important world events on their day of birth, their power color, the signs they are most compatible with, a description of their personality, their lucky number, their lucky time, and their general mood.

 ## Build: v 1.0

 ## Code: 
     Utilized HTML/CSS (foundation), jQuery, JavaScript

 ## APIs: 
     https://sameer-kumar-aztro-v1.p.rapidapi.com/?sign=

## Mock-Up
![A user enters their DOB and then important events for their birthday and their astrological data is displayed](./docs/images/mockup.png)

 ## Utilization:
